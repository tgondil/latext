## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd latext
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up Gemini AI (for AI enhancement)**:
   - Get your API key from [Google AI Studio](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```env
     REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
     ```
   - See [SETUP.md](SETUP.md) for detailed configuration

4. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

### Available Scripts

- `npm start` - Runs the app in development mode
- `npm run build` - Builds the app for production
- `npm run dev` - Starts development server and opens browser

## How It Works

### With AI Enhancement (Recommended)
1. **Input**: Enter your text in the left panel
2. **AI Analysis**: Gemini AI analyzes your content using chain-of-thought reasoning
3. **Academic Structuring**: AI creates proper sections, abstracts, and formatting
4. **LaTeX Generation**: Produces professional LaTeX code with academic conventions
5. **Rendering**: See your beautifully formatted academic paper in real-time
6. **Export**: Copy the generated LaTeX code to use in your LaTeX editor

### Basic Mode (Fallback)
1. **Input**: Enter your text in the left panel
2. **Processing**: Fast rule-based conversion to LaTeX format
3. **Rendering**: Basic academic paper structure with standard formatting
4. **Export**: Copy the generated LaTeX code

## Text-to-LaTeX Conversion

LaText intelligently converts your text using these rules:

- **Title**: First paragraph or sentence becomes the paper title
- **Abstract**: Generated from the first substantial paragraph
- **Sections**: Automatically creates logical sections from your content
- **Formatting**: Supports bold (*text*), italic (_text_), and lists
- **Citations**: Converts [1] style references to proper LaTeX citations

Machine Learning in Healthcare

This paper explores the applications of machine learning in modern healthcare systems. We examine various algorithms and their effectiveness in medical diagnosis and treatment planning.

The use of artificial intelligence in healthcare has grown significantly over the past decade. Machine learning algorithms can analyze vast amounts of medical data to identify patterns and make predictions.

Data preprocessing is crucial for successful machine learning applications. We collected patient data from multiple sources and applied various cleaning techniques.

Our results show that machine learning models can achieve high accuracy in medical diagnosis tasks. The models demonstrated particularly strong performance in image analysis and patient outcome prediction.
